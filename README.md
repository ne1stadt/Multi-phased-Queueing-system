# Multi-phased-Queueing-system

This repository contains simulation of multi-phased queueing system.

To run simulation, access the simulation.py file in simulation folder, set input parameters, they are presented as variables after import section and run simulation.py.

You can find my runs in RUN folder.

There is also untitled.ipynb file that interprets results and compares them to the simplest analytical model.

Note:
Code is very unoptimized. It's only KPI is accuracy. It is accurate. But very slow.

P. S. loggerEnabled = True significantly slows the simulation, so use wisley.
